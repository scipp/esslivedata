Test workflow factory registration and instantiation.

This test file validates workflow factories by loading factory implementations.
These tests are slower than workflow_spec_test.py because they import heavy
dependencies (sciline, ess.reduce, etc.).

For fast spec-only tests, see registered_workflow_specs_test.py.
