> Cell Selection Mechanism: Would you prefer:

Not sure, easy option would be to simple have a button that directly triggers to plot callback... but then we cannot select more than a single cell?

> Region Selection Behavior: For selecting rectangular regions:
> Option A: Click first cell, then click second cell to define opposite corners

This sounds elegant and answers my question above! I suppose if we click twice into the same cell it must then be interpreted as selecting a 1x1 "grid"?

> Callback Interface: How should the plot insertion callback work?
> Option A: Callback receives (row, col, row_span, col_span) and returns hv.DynamicMap
> Option B: Callback receives (row, col, row_span, col_span) and is responsible for calling back with the plot
> Option C: Two-phase: selection triggers "configure plot" dialog, then plot is inserted

I don't think the callback should now about the grid at all! It might need zero arguments - all it does is hand of to a mechanism in the controller? But it does need to be able to display a modal dialog where the users selects/configures. So maybe we need slightly more than a callback? Unless the dialog handling could be done in the parent widget?

> Plot Replacement: If a cell/region already has a plot:
> Option A: Clear selection button required before new plot can be added
> Option B: Allow overwriting existing plots
> Option C: Show warning/confirmation dialog

We should not allow selecting cells that have a plot, nor selecting a rectangle that overlaps a plot. That is, show an error. But we need something to remove existing plots. Maybe a simple "Close" button ("X") in a corner?

> Empty Cell Display: What should empty cells show?
> Option A: Just the selection control (checkbox/button)
> Option B: Selection control + placeholder text/icon
> Option C: Styled empty box with centered selection control

I think the entire cell should serve as selection point. We should display some small placeholder text, something like "Click to add plot"?

> Integration Point: Where should this widget be used?
> In the existing PlotCreationWidget as an alternative to tabs?
> As a standalone widget in a new dashboard view?
> Replacing the "Plots" tab in PlotCreationWidget?

It will replace what we have, but for now we need to build this standalone an test it. It has to work without any of the other infrastructure. The implementation plan should include something on making a tiny Panel app for testing this, which simply creates some DynamicMap with random data in the callbacks.
