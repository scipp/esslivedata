# PlotGrid Widget Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a new `PlotGrid` widget for the ESSlivedata dashboard that allows users to create customizable grid layouts for displaying multiple HoloViews plots.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Widget (`src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_grid.py`)

**Key Features:**
- Configurable grid dimensions (nrows × ncols)
- Two-click cell selection (click start corner, click end corner)
- Rectangular region selection with automatic normalization
- Plot insertion via callback mechanism
- Plot removal with close button
- Overlap detection and prevention
- Visual feedback for selection in progress
- Error notifications for invalid selections

**Design Decisions:**
- Based on Panel's `GridSpec` for flexible layout management
- Follows existing widget patterns (not inheriting from Panel classes, exposes `.panel` property)
- Uses button-based cells for reliable click handling
- Callback receives no position arguments - PlotGrid manages layout internally
- Empty cells show "Click to add plot" placeholder text
- Close button (×) is always visible in top-right corner of plots
- Uses `.layout` pattern for HoloViews DynamicMap rendering

**State Management:**
- `_occupied_cells`: Tracks which regions contain plots
- `_first_click`: Stores first click position during selection
- `_pending_selection`: Stores region coordinates between callback and insertion
- `_plot_creation_in_flight`: Boolean flag to prevent concurrent workflows
- Cell highlighting is managed dynamically via `_get_cell_for_state()` method

### 2. Comprehensive Tests (`tests/dashboard/widgets/test_plot_grid.py`)

**Test Coverage (20 tests, all passing):**
- Grid initialization and configuration
- Single cell and rectangular region selection
- Selection normalization (works regardless of click order)
- Cell highlighting during selection
- Occupancy checking (single cells and regions)
- Plot insertion at correct positions (using deferred insertion API)
- Multiple plot insertion
- Plot removal and cell restoration
- Region availability detection
- Callback invocation timing
- Error handling (callback failures with cancel_pending_selection)

**Test Fixtures:**
- `mock_plot`: Creates sample HoloViews DynamicMap
- `mock_callback`: Async callback (returns None) for testing deferred insertion workflow

**Note:** Tests updated for dashboard integration (commit 9f93af96) to use the new async/deferred API:
- Callback no longer returns a plot directly
- Tests call `insert_plot_deferred(mock_plot)` after callback invocation
- Error tests verify `cancel_pending_selection()` properly cleans up state

**Test Coverage Limitations:**
- Unit tests cover PlotGrid in isolation with mock callbacks
- Integration with PlotGridTab and modals verified through manual testing
- Race conditions fixed in subsequent commits are not covered by automated tests

### 3. Demo Application (`examples/plot_grid_demo.py`)

**Features:**
- Standalone Panel application (no dependency on ESSlivedata services/controllers)
- Four plot types: curves, scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts
- All plots are HoloViews DynamicMaps with interactive widgets
- Plot type selector (radio buttons)
- Grid configuration controls (rows, columns)
- Clear instructions and feature documentation

**Running the Demo:**
```bash
panel serve examples/plot_grid_demo.py --show
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Callback Interface

The widget uses an async callback interface for dashboard integration:

```python
def plot_request_callback() -> None:
    # External code handles data selection, configuration modal, etc.
    # Does NOT return a plot - uses deferred insertion instead
    pass
```

After the async workflow completes, the caller should:
- Call `grid.insert_plot_deferred(plot)` to complete the insertion, OR
- Call `grid.cancel_pending_selection()` to abort and reset state

The callback does not receive any position information - the PlotGrid manages all layout state internally.

### Plot Insertion Flow

1. User clicks first cell → cell is highlighted
2. User clicks second cell → region is determined
3. PlotGrid validates region is available (no overlaps)
4. PlotGrid stores pending selection internally
5. PlotGrid sets `_plot_creation_in_flight` flag (disables all cells)
6. PlotGrid calls callback (async, returns nothing)
7. Callback shows modal dialogs, collects configuration
8. Caller creates plot and calls `grid.insert_plot_deferred(plot)`
9. PlotGrid inserts plot at stored selection position
10. PlotGrid clears in-flight flag and pending selection state

### Error Handling

- Invalid selections (overlapping occupied cells) show temporary error notifications
- Callback errors are handled by caller using `cancel_pending_selection()`
- Pending selection persists until `insert_plot_deferred()` or `cancel_pending_selection()` is called
- In-flight flag prevents concurrent plot creation workflows
- Notifications use `pn.state.notifications` (gracefully handles test environment)

### Visual Design

**Empty Cells:**
- Light gray background (#f8f9fa)
- Centered placeholder text "Click to add plot"
- 1px solid border (#dee2e6)
- Hover effect (darker background)

**Selection in Progress:**
- Blue dashed border (3px, #007bff)
- Light blue background (#e7f3ff)

**Occupied Cells:**
- Plot fills entire cell/region
- Close button (×) in top-right corner
- Red danger-style button
- Always visible (not just on hover)

## Integration with Existing Codebase

The PlotGrid widget follows all existing patterns:

✅ Widget class exposes `.panel` property
✅ Uses Panel components (GridSpec, Button, Column)
✅ Callback-based communication (no direct coupling)
✅ Proper type hints throughout
✅ NumPy-style docstrings
✅ Comprehensive unit tests
✅ Passes `ruff` linting and formatting
✅ Follows SPDX license headers

## Code Quality

**Linting:** All files pass `ruff check` and `ruff format`
**Tests:** 20/20 tests passing
**Type Hints:** Full type annotation coverage
**Documentation:** Complete docstrings and usage examples

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Keyboard Support**: Add ESC key handling to cancel selection (requires JavaScript integration)
2. **Drag-to-Select**: Allow dragging to select regions (alternative to two-click)
3. **Grid Resizing**: Dynamic grid size adjustment without page reload
4. **Plot Serialization**: Save/load grid layouts to configuration
5. **Cell Borders**: Optional grid lines for visual clarity
6. **Responsive Sizing**: Better handling of different screen sizes
7. **Plot Swapping**: Drag and drop to rearrange plots
8. **Multi-Selection**: Select and operate on multiple plots at once

✅ Callback is invoked after region selection
✅ Returned plots are correctly inserted into the grid
✅ Plots can be removed via close button
✅ Demo app successfully demonstrates all functionality
✅ Tests verify core behaviors
✅ Code follows project conventions and passes linting

## Dashboard Integration

The PlotGrid has been successfully integrated into the ESSlivedata dashboard (commit 9f93af96):

**New Components:**
- [PlotGridTab](../../src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_grid_tab.py): Orchestrates the two-modal workflow
- [JobPlotterSelectionModal](../../src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/job_plotter_selection_modal.py): First modal for job/output and plotter selection
- [PlotConfigurationAdapter](../../src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_configuration_adapter.py): Reusable adapter for configuration modal

**Integration Points:**
- Added "Plot Grid" tab to [PlotCreationWidget](../../src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_creation_widget.py)
- Reuses existing `ConfigurationModal` without modifications
- Uses deferred insertion API (`insert_plot_deferred()` and `cancel_pending_selection()`)

**Workflow:**
1. User selects region in 3×3 grid
2. `JobPlotterSelectionModal` shows job/output table and plotter selection
3. `ConfigurationModal` shows plotter-specific configuration
4. Plot is created via `PlottingController`
5. Plot is inserted into grid at selected position

See [plot-grid-integration-plan.md](plot-grid-integration-plan.md) for detailed integration documentation.

### Known Issues and Fixes

**Issue 1: Plots not appearing after modal workflow completion**
- **Root cause:** Race condition where `_on_plot_created()` inserted plot, then ConfigurationModal close event triggered `cancel_pending_selection()`, undoing the insertion
- **Fix:** Clear modal reference before inserting plot in `PlotGridTab._on_plot_created()` ([commit details](../../src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_grid_tab.py#L128-L133))

**Issue 2: Cells re-enabling when second modal opens**
- **Root cause:** `JobPlotterSelectionModal` closed first modal, then its close handler called `cancel_callback()` which reset grid state
- **Fix:** Track `_success_callback_invoked` flag and skip cancel callback if success was already called ([commit details](../../src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/job_plotter_selection_modal.py#L52))

**Pattern:** Both fixes follow the same strategy - mark success state **before** triggering events that might fire cleanup handlers.

**Testing:** These race conditions require modal close events and are verified through manual testing. Unit tests cover PlotGrid behavior in isolation.

## Conclusion

The PlotGrid widget is fully implemented, tested, documented, and integrated into the ESSlivedata dashboard. It provides a flexible foundation for creating multi-plot dashboard layouts with a user-friendly modal workflow for plot configuration.
