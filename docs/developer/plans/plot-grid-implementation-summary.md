# PlotGrid Widget Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a new `PlotGrid` widget for the ESSlivedata dashboard that allows users to create customizable grid layouts for displaying multiple HoloViews plots.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Widget (`src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_grid.py`)

**Key Features:**
- Configurable grid dimensions (nrows × ncols)
- Two-click cell selection (click start corner, click end corner)
- Rectangular region selection with automatic normalization
- Plot insertion via callback mechanism
- Plot removal with close button
- Overlap detection and prevention
- Visual feedback for selection in progress
- Error notifications for invalid selections

**Design Decisions:**
- Based on Panel's `GridSpec` for flexible layout management
- Follows existing widget patterns (not inheriting from Panel classes, exposes `.panel` property)
- Uses button-based cells for reliable click handling
- Callback receives no position arguments - PlotGrid manages layout internally
- Empty cells show "Click to add plot" placeholder text
- Close button (×) is always visible in top-right corner of plots
- Uses `.layout` pattern for HoloViews DynamicMap rendering

**State Management:**
- `_occupied_cells`: Tracks which regions contain plots
- `_first_click`: Stores first click position during selection
- `_highlighted_cell`: Tracks highlighted cell for visual feedback
- `_pending_selection`: Stores region coordinates between callback and insertion

### 2. Comprehensive Tests (`tests/dashboard/widgets/test_plot_grid.py`)

**Test Coverage (20 tests, all passing):**
- Grid initialization and configuration
- Single cell and rectangular region selection
- Selection normalization (works regardless of click order)
- Cell highlighting during selection
- Occupancy checking (single cells and regions)
- Plot insertion at correct positions
- Multiple plot insertion
- Plot removal and cell restoration
- Region availability detection
- Callback invocation timing
- Error handling (callback failures)

**Test Fixtures:**
- `mock_plot`: Creates sample HoloViews DynamicMap
- `mock_callback`: Returns mock plot on invocation

### 3. Demo Application (`examples/plot_grid_demo.py`)

**Features:**
- Standalone Panel application (no dependency on ESSlivedata services/controllers)
- Four plot types: curves, scatter plots, heatmaps, bar charts
- All plots are HoloViews DynamicMaps with interactive widgets
- Plot type selector (radio buttons)
- Grid configuration controls (rows, columns)
- Clear instructions and feature documentation

**Running the Demo:**
```bash
panel serve examples/plot_grid_demo.py --show
```

### 4. Documentation

**Created Files:**
- `examples/README.md`: Demo documentation and usage instructions
- `docs/developer/plans/plot-grid-implementation-summary.md`: This summary

## Technical Implementation Details

### Callback Interface

The widget uses a simple callback interface:

```python
def plot_request_callback() -> hv.DynamicMap:
    # External code handles data selection, configuration modal, etc.
    # Returns the plot to insert
    return my_plot
```

The callback does not receive any position information - the PlotGrid manages all layout state internally.

### Plot Insertion Flow

1. User clicks first cell → cell is highlighted
2. User clicks second cell → region is determined
3. PlotGrid validates region is available (no overlaps)
4. PlotGrid stores pending selection internally
5. PlotGrid calls callback to get plot
6. Callback returns `hv.DynamicMap` (may show modal dialog first)
7. PlotGrid inserts plot at stored selection position
8. Selection state is cleared

### Error Handling

- Invalid selections (overlapping occupied cells) show temporary error notifications
- Callback errors prevent plot insertion but don't break widget state
- Selection state is always cleared after callback (success or failure)
- Notifications use `pn.state.notifications` (gracefully handles test environment)

### Visual Design

**Empty Cells:**
- Light gray background (#f8f9fa)
- Centered placeholder text "Click to add plot"
- 1px solid border (#dee2e6)
- Hover effect (darker background)

**Selection in Progress:**
- Blue dashed border (3px, #007bff)
- Light blue background (#e7f3ff)

**Occupied Cells:**
- Plot fills entire cell/region
- Close button (×) in top-right corner
- Red danger-style button
- Always visible (not just on hover)

## Integration with Existing Codebase

The PlotGrid widget follows all existing patterns:

✅ Widget class exposes `.panel` property
✅ Uses Panel components (GridSpec, Button, Column)
✅ Callback-based communication (no direct coupling)
✅ Proper type hints throughout
✅ NumPy-style docstrings
✅ Comprehensive unit tests
✅ Passes `ruff` linting and formatting
✅ Follows SPDX license headers

## Code Quality

**Linting:** All files pass `ruff check` and `ruff format`
**Tests:** 20/20 tests passing
**Type Hints:** Full type annotation coverage
**Documentation:** Complete docstrings and usage examples

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Keyboard Support**: Add ESC key handling to cancel selection (requires JavaScript integration)
2. **Drag-to-Select**: Allow dragging to select regions (alternative to two-click)
3. **Grid Resizing**: Dynamic grid size adjustment without page reload
4. **Plot Serialization**: Save/load grid layouts to configuration
5. **Cell Borders**: Optional grid lines for visual clarity
6. **Responsive Sizing**: Better handling of different screen sizes
7. **Plot Swapping**: Drag and drop to rearrange plots
8. **Multi-Selection**: Select and operate on multiple plots at once

## Files Created/Modified

**Created:**

## Testing Instructions

**Unit Tests:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/dashboard/widgets/test_plot_grid.py -v
```

**Demo Application:**
```bash
panel serve examples/plot_grid_demo.py --show
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
ruff check src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_grid.py
ruff format src/ess/livedata/dashboard/widgets/plot_grid.py
```

## Success Criteria (All Met)

✅ PlotGrid widget can be instantiated with custom dimensions
✅ Users can select single cells and rectangular regions via two clicks
✅ Selection is prevented when overlapping existing plots
✅ Callback is invoked after region selection
✅ Returned plots are correctly inserted into the grid
✅ Plots can be removed via close button
✅ Demo app successfully demonstrates all functionality
✅ Tests verify core behaviors
✅ Code follows project conventions and passes linting

## Conclusion

The PlotGrid widget is fully implemented, tested, and documented. It provides a flexible foundation for creating multi-plot dashboard layouts in ESSlivedata and can be easily integrated into the existing dashboard architecture.
